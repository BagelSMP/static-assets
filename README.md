[![Update Pack-Hashes](https://github.com/BagelSMP/static-assets/actions/workflows/hashes.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BagelSMP/static-assets/actions/workflows/hashes.yml)

Static Assets, please note, do not rename anything as they are imported by production servers

### Developer note:

makesure to generate a sha1 hash for every texture pack, using `./generateHash.bat` or the github action

also, some .sh files are executables others arent. While they look the same in an editor, they are diffrent
